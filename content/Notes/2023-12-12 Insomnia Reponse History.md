I was trying to talk to the [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) API and it seems my developer token expired and I can't resolve https://developer.feedly.com/v3/developer/.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that Insomnia [keeps around history](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/responses#access-response-history):

So I still had access to previously successful responses. Notice I'm getting 401 responses now.

If i'm reading this right; it seems only Pro accounts have API access:
