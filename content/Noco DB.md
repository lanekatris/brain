# Background

So I love Airtable but I was pushing the limits of my plan and it was getting a bit expensive for a hobby program.

I recently found https://nocodb.com/ and it looks fantastic. I can even use Postgres (I'm using https://neon.tech/) as a backing store!

There isn't a calendar view and there aren't "widgets" support, like where you can use google maps with your location data. Looks like no mobile app too but not a big deal as it has forms. I think these lack of features is fine, seems to hit what I need. 

The Full Calendar experience and using Frontmatter is just a lot of work for desktop AND mobile. I love the simplicity of Obsidian but for certain types of data it's not a fit. I'm being very careful though not to over-engineer as that is my kryponite for personal projects.

I'm reassured though, that I loved working with Airtable, I just hit limits and *I'm cheap*. NocoDB is very similar, so I'm confident it will be a good fit ðŸ¤ž
