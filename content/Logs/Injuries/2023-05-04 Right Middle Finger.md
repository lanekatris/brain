I was working on a V7 (at my gym) and I didn't notice but a few days later I woke up and making a fist gave some minor discomfort on the right lower tendon of the finger.

It is feeling slightly better 3 days later and I think power gripping with disc golf slightly aggravated it.

Regardless, I taped it on 5/7 and I think I'll remain doing that since this is my dominant hand AND finger for climbing
