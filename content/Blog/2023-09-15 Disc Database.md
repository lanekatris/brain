# Why?

I'm a big fan of disc golf. My landing page all things disc golf: [[Disc Golf]]

Discs are obviously a big deal. You buy or find discs (with no name), lose discs (a lot), or get mesmerized by majestic tour stamped discs.

I usually try to keep my [[Disc Golf Gear List]] separate from by disc database.

I'm not into discs as much as others, even after being into disc golf for years. I am a software engineer, and with that my nerdi-ness of wanting to keep stats takes over.

> So I keep track of all new and lost discs I accumulate so I can see counts / stats.

I've missed some here and there of course, not a perfect bookkeeper. 

### I've tried different ways to keep track of discs:
- Excel file
- Obsidian markdown
- JSON file on GitHub
- EventstoreDB
- (**Active**) Postgres + [[Noco DB]]

Every time, every implementation, eventually, the DB stops getting updated because it's not simple enough. 

### I want these qualities from a disc database:
- Easy to update from desktop or mobile
- Private edit
- Easily shared / public viewable read-only
- Structured data

So I'm using neon.tech Postgres + [[Noco DB]] . Noco is free/open source and gives me the structured data I want and a nice UI to edit it. Nowadays it seems to work on mobile. I can either host a view on my website or just query SQL and render it how I want so others can view it.
# How?

**Database**
I'm using https://neon.tech/ for free Postgres hosting. I don't want to worry about backups or losing data.

My schema is one table. It could be normalized more but I don't care:
```
create table noco.disc
(
    brand      text,
    color      text,
    model      text,
    plastic    text,
    number     bigint,
    status     text,
    weight     bigint,
    created    date,
    price      numeric,
    notes      text,
    aces       bigint,
    id         integer   default nextval('noco.discs_source_csv_id_seq'::regclass) not null
        constraint discs_source_csv_pkey
            primary key,
    created_at timestamp default now(),
    updated_at timestamp default now()
);
```
(Some of the columns are auto-generated by Noco but that's a bit obvious)

Probably, the most important, column, is... `number`. It's really nice to be over 100 now. Also, it's nice to differentiate help similarly colored no stamp discs:

**Editing**
I use [Noco DB](https://nocodb.com/) running from a [docker compose file](https://github.com/lanekatris/monorepo/blob/main/infrastructure/homelab/docker-compose.yml). I love how close this is to Airtable. I mean it is far from it, but I like the experience.

Noco DB is hosted via [[2023-09-06 Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel Setup]] so I can edit/view from anywhere.

**Viewing**
For now, Noco's "views" will do the job. It's just an `iframe`. 
Available here: https://loonison.com/discs

Another pro of using the view is you can download as CSV or XLSX. So others can take the same format if they want and I don't have to write any UI or export API code ðŸ’ª

# To Dos

- [ ] Show picture(s) of discs
- [ ] Delete JSON file from `/data` folder on GitHub
- [ ] Link this to blog index, link this to disc golf projects
- [ ] link to architecture?

# After Thoughts

I've been using this for a while, just thought I'd document it. 

I'm mixing hosting locally and a cloud database, but I think this gives:
- Free (besides power)
- Data automatically backed up
- Secure public access with Cloudflare
- Minimal custom code

Along with this project, I want a similar flow to: [[2023-09-16 New Project - Upload Udisc Scorecards and Populate Feed]].
