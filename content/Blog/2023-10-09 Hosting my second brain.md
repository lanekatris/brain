I've been gaming of late with the colder rainy fall weather so I'm on windows. I had to upgrade Node.js.

So locally things look great. I definately want to make tweaks to the layout but that is for another day. 

Since I want to keep everything in Obsidian to author and link, I think I will copy over to the `Content` folder in Quartz. 

I don't have crazy secret things in my vault but there are sensitive finances and other personal items. So, I keep everything in a `Public` folder in my vault that I want to expose. I used this folder when I was using [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). 

I'll just do the same, hopefully it's easy ğŸ˜‰ copy from `Public` -> `Content`.
