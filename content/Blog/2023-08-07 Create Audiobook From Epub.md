*DALL-E: visualize audio space from the heavans*

# Issue

I'm a slacker and don't read traditional books. I ingest plenty of articles online day to day though.

I want to listen to [Mountaineering: Freedom of the Hills](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076H9532R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

# Goal

I want to play this book audibly on my phone while driving. To pull that off my plan was:
1. Get the eBook (Amazon Kindle)
2. Convert to text ([calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/))
3. Create mp3 to listen to on my phone ([Spotify](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/local-files/) and maybe OneDrive to get it over there or something)

# Converting to Text

I'm unable to get past the DRM.

So I downloaded the epub from https://libgen.rocks/index.php
> ![Fail]
> I do not condone illegal activity. You should pay for ebooks.

I did [install Clam AV](https://askubuntu.com/questions/417429/how-can-i-scan-for-possible-viruses-on-my-ubuntu-system) and scanned the file...

Install Calibre
```
sudo -v && wget -nv -O- https://download.calibre-ebook.com/linux-installer.sh | sudo sh /dev/stdin
```

Convert epub to txt
```
ebook-convert source.epub out.txt
```

> [!Info] This created a `1.9 MB` text file with `1,924,541` characters


I manually edited some of the beginning and index. No automated way to do that to with raw text to my knowledge. This brought the file to `1.8 MB` and `1,811,393` characters.

# Creating Audio

I spent a little bit of time looking into:
- https://github.com/mozilla/TTS
- https://aws.amazon.com/polly/

For the sake of time I decided to go the paid route with Amazon Polly.

Unfortunately, Polly only accepts 100K [characters at a time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/limits.html). So we need to split up the file:
```
split -b100000 out.txt
```

> [!Info] You need the aws cli installed and a bucket for the next steps, swap out the bucket `lkat`

Upload the text file to S3:

```
aws s3 cp ./out.txt s3://lkat/audiobooks/freedom-of-the-hills/out.txt
```

> [!Error] This **will** cost money

```
aws polly start-speech-synthesis-task \ --engine `standard` --region `us-east-1` \ --endpoint-url "`https://polly.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`" \ --output-format mp3 \ --output-s3-bucket-name `lkat` \ --output-s3-key-prefix `audiobooks/freedom-of-the-hills` \ --voice-id Joey \ --text `file://out.txt`
```

# File Management
I decided to merge all files 

# Mobile Play

### Original Plan
Now that the mp3's are generated, lets make them available on your phone via Spotify.

I originally thought that I needed Onedrive to sync files, enable local files on mobile, and then point to the files on Onedrive. *This is **not** the way*.

### Better Way
[This article](https://sports.yahoo.com/upload-local-music-spotify-play-184024446.html)

**On Spotify desktop**:
* Enable *Show Local Files*
- Add the folder with you mp3s with *Add a source*
- Create a playlist
- Go to your Library and then *Local Files*, multi-select your mp3s, right click, add to your playlist

**On Spotify mobile**:
- Click your playlist
- Choose download playlist

Now you have your audio book with Spotify tracking your listen history ðŸŽ‰
