### Info
This was **unsanctioned**.

I've done 3 tournaments, this being the 3rd. It was my first in doubles. We only beat the next card by one point but it was good effort. We had a little bit of rain as well but it was negligible. 

### Warming Up

> [!error] When warming up I lost 2 discs!

One was found, one was not ðŸ˜­

I'll look for it another time but it could have made it to the river. I *know better* than to warm up my drives on holes with potential lose-disc hazards ðŸ¤·

This was my TODO "red disc" Sidewinder that is still lost.
