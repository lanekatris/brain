Reocurring tasks vs Google Calendar
- Worming horses

I got inspiration from TODO and am putting events into a folder and tagging. Then I can click on a tag instead of remembering folder structure. A good case for this is for maintenance. Whenever we give the dog wormer or change the oil in the car I can create a stream of files and then aggregate them together by tag.

More workflow centric things are good for folder structure. For example, invoicing clients. I create an invoice in the `invoices` folder. After it is paid, it moves to `invoices/archived`. These could be tagged but it helps to see an empty folder as that shows "there is nothing to do".
