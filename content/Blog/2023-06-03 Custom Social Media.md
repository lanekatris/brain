Really as I blog or want something like Mastodon; it can be done with obsidian. 

Now you get into a generalized thing that doesn't work great but I don't care, I don't need all fancy obsidian. So how about I just stick with obsidian, and can always convert content if I ever want to. 

For now I have the categories:
- Blog
- Projects

I may just add things to blog or maybe I'll have something like a feed with goofy posts. 

I also want a central feed and/or RSS. That is a project for another day.
