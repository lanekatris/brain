I dual boot Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04 and have used Ubuntu exclusively for a week now. It keeps me from wasting time gaming and working on technical projects or organizing things digitally. 

Sometimes you need to spice things up computer wise. A mac feels good as well, so trying to reel that in to the desktop.
