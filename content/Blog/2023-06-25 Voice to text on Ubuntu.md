There isn't a native text to speech function on Ubuntu but I keep a Google Doc tab pinned and do speech to text there that gets the job done.

I can copy paste into obsidian so that addition to my workflow works and isn't too hateful.

It's an extra step but not a big deal whenever you can talk faster than you can type, and I can type pretty fast, but I can also talk pretty fast.
