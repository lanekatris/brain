I switched to my other OS, Ubuntu, where I'm not running the Cloudflare tunnel cli. I have my software running.

So this is straightforward, probably easier. Or the software could be pub/sub and more **complex** and not need Cloudflare cli...

Classic access/communication to the cloud minor problem.

I'm not sure what I'll end up doing, I'll probably choose the **simplest/easiest** solution. I do need to change the code to support linux thought.
