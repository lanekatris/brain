Since I accidentally killed access to my Cloudflare Zero Trust apps (see [[2023-09-05 Broke All My Cloudflare Tunnel DNS Resolution]]), and i'm using Netlify to handle nameservers for my other web apps, I thought it's time to buy these domains I've been wanting to:

**Cost**: $38 / 1yr

I hope to create a software all-in-one product that links together all the software that I enjoy or that makes my life easier in a semi-polished offering.

### troykatris.com
**Cost**: $10 / 1yr

This is for my son! He's 2.5 years old. Not sure what tooling or framework I'll use for this site as a placeholder. Maybe some pictures of him using [Astro](https://astro.build/). When he's older we'll change it so he can take ownership and use it in his professional life.
