As we all know, I love my [[2023-09-15 Disc Database]]. I got a few discs last week I needed to add. I wasn't at my computer since I was watching the kiddo. I tried on mobile and literally couldn't open the table. I eventually got an iPad and it was barely usable.

I updated to `202.5` ([Commit](https://github.com/lanekatris/monorepo/commit/9984f5e46767539c69af50623cdc2387b652414b))
[2023-10-16 Cloudflare R2 Storage.md](2023-10-16%20Cloudflare%20R2%20Storage.md)
Now I'm happy. I almost wanted to investigate and witch to https://www.getgrist.com/. 

Grist seems really powerful but I really like Noco DB's simplicity and connection up to Postgres. I can then slice and dice the data via SQL as I need.
