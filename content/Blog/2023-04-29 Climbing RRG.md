Went to [Muir Valley](https://muirvalley.org/) on Saturday. Spent all our time in the **Bowling Alley** crag.

First time putting my [guide book](https://bestofthered.com/products/the-red-2nd-edition) to use.

Took no pictures, there was 3 of us. Over time I'll create a list of my gear and some of the to dos I have before and after climbing.

Before I was recording climbs in [mountainproject.com](https://www.mountainproject.com/) and [8a.nu](https://www.8a.nu/). At this point I don't climb enough outside so I plan on just recording on Mountain Project. Future state I want to record the data personally and run my own stats on it.

### Notes
- First time falling outside (which isn't good that it's been this long) but they were small, safe falls, so it's a start
- Didn't bring a tripod for the GoPro so didn't bring it out
- The next day, I noticed that I'm almost out of collagen. Need to buy more
- Not too many scrapes, my harness digs in near my groin. Probably because I don't get out much, but if I do use it more and feels the same way I'd consider buying a new one
