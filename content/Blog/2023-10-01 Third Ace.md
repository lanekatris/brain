Got my 3rd ace at [Valley Park](https://udisc.com/courses/valley-park-yrsu) on hole #16, the triple mando hole. 

It was really a roller coaster of a round, not my best round either.

But, I threw my #68 Destroyer forehand into the basket.  ([[2023-09-15 Disc Database]]) (https://loonison.com/discs)

It is pretty cool that I have one with a putter, mid range and driver. 

The first 2 were back hand.
