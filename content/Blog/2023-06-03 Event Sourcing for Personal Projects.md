As I try to simplify my personal projects I want to know the history of things changing.

Well instead of having to use a library or writing code; you know sometimes I just want to mess with data...

I decided to use plain JSON files and git to know about history. That way I'm not writing code to understand history, I just keep a stateful representation which is really common and I can always look at git file history if I need to know more ðŸ¤·
