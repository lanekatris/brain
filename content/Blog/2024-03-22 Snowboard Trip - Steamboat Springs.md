We are using [Wanderlog](https://wanderlog.com/) to plan.

Hurt my neck 1.5 weeks prior so I did no physical activity for that time in preparation for snowboarding.

# Post Trip

Starting a [[Vacation Grocery List]]. Right now it includes things for adults and a 3 yr old.

Starting to keep track of [[Organization]] to make traveling easier.

I forgot my Burton backpack! So I used our diaper bag. It worked well. It wasn't water proof but no big deal. The worst part was having no sternum strap and it was pulling on my shoulders. I used a buddies sock elastic band and a keyring clip and it worked really well:

Our rental vehicle was a van: Toyota Sienna. It worked well and my son could open the door by himself. The biggest con was that it was 2-wheel drive, and we couldn't visit some state parks that had moderately bad road conditions.

The [Strawberry Park Hot Springs](https://strawberryhotsprings.com/) were awesome! First time I've done a cold plunge. I went in a few times, my longest time was 1m 30s.

If we are back in the area in the winter we should try cross country skiing in the Steamboat Lake area instead of the resort. There is also lodging up this way away from the resort.

Routt National Forest is pronounced like "route".

I always forget how the weather can change so drastically in a short 15 mile drive in Colorado.

Got a Colorado state parks [passport](https://coloradooutdoorsmag.com/2018/08/07/colorados-passport-to-adventure/) (More on [[Passports]]):

I should have gotten more stickers. I have a scrapbook per-se, and haven't updated it for a while. I think I'd like to continue. So that would be stickers for my snowboarding helmet, scrapbook, Nalgene water bottle, or disc golf cart. I don't have a laptop, the wife does; but I don't want to add any to hers.

Played a bunch of disc golf.

I started throwing forehands a little early and noticed the right side of my neck hurting, so I quit. Luckily a day or two break made it OK and I was able to throw forehand at the end of our trip.

Going from snow to 70s and 80 degree days was a change. Luckily SPF 30 spray sunscreen worked well üëç
