# Pre Trip

**Car Stuff**
- Tires were low, it had been a while since I filled them ðŸ˜…
- TPMS was saying multiple tires were flat ðŸ¤·Had to reset the TPMS and was good to go

# During Trip
- Not the best food

# Post Trip

**Disc Golf**
- Most fun I've had playing in the rain since I don't play in the rain often

**Buying**
- `$9.99`  [Sunglass Cases](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W6PRKGP/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3OAW7ZJCWQZT6&psc=1) - Tired of my cheap sunglasses getting scratched up. I have Chums but that doesn't help prevent getting scratched
- `$9.99` [Sleeping Mask](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GSO1D9O/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A6CQF6TQU15UK&psc=1) - Seems odd for a dude I know... but with a kid you don't have perfect sleeping conditions
