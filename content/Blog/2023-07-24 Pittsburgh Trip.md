### Day 1
- Disc golf at North Boundary Park (Blue Layout)
- Booked a hotel at a Marriott
- Disc golf at Knob Hill

### Day 2
- Drove through McConnells Mill State Park (wanted to hike but didn't)
- Disc golf at Moraine (Gold Layout)
- Disc golf at East Palestine DGC (partial round)
- Drove through and got a VIPP stamp at Tomlinson Run State Park

### Notes
**General**
- We left early in the morning but it was fine. Troy needed a break so we had a sit down breakfast
- I should plan more around Troy, we need to get him some more playground time that is **not** at the hottest part of the day
- No lost discs!

**North Boundary**
- I **DO NOT** recommend a cart or a stroller at North Boundary
- Lot's of elevation, twice as much as Redeemer
- There were yellow jackets at one of the practice baskets at the pole. I got bit on the ankle and ever so slightly on the thumb

**Hotel**
- Was nice and got the job done but no water sitting out and no microwave in the room. I suppose you get what you pay for
- Was clean
- The pool almost didn't fit in the room but no problemo

**Knob Hill**
- Unfortunately Lianne didn't get play much since Troy was having melt downs
- Was nice to have a more relaxing course
- This would be a great warm up for North Boundary

**McConnells Mill State Park**
- Wanted to hit another park but we decided not to get out as we new the course would take a long time
- Looks like there were some waterfalls on some hikes that were short, would be good with kids to my knowledge

**Moraine**
- Top tier course, humbles you, reminds you that your not good at disc golf
- Played gold layout, wanted the whole experience; was worth it
- My backhand throw is messed up, I keep shaping too far left event for straight or hyzer shots. I'll need to fix this 
- This is really an amazing course, watch out for player traffic though
- I bet its pretty magical in the fall, there are a ton of thorny bushes though

**East Palestine DGC**
- Had to leave early since it was the hottest part of the day and Troy was melting down
- Nice little course, would like to see the rest, seems reasonable

**Tomlinson Run State Park**
- I always feel bad to just drive through a park when there is hiking, camping, pool, disc golf, etc.
- Got the VIPP stamp
- I wanted to hit this park since it's in the northern panhandle and out of the way typically; as I'm trying to hit all the state parks in WV
- There are a bunch state parks around here: WV, OH, and PA. So with more time, I would like to check a bunch of them out in one go
