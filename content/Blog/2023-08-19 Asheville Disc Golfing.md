> We were told that no one has done it pushing a stroller, and I was the only 4th or 5th to take a cart - *Us WV folk are different* ðŸ˜‚

# North Cove

I didn't realize there was a tournament going on so we had to play the *Boulders* course. 

# Linville Caverns

Was short but a great tour.

# Notes

We thought about playing Harmon Hills but decided differently. We had a late start Saturday.

We hit 2 of the [top 5](https://udisc.com/blog/post/5-best-disc-golf-courses-in-each-us-state-2023) courses for North Carolina!
