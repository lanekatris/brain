#### Find The Parts

1. PartSelect has various parts listed with the exact ones I needed [listed first](https://www.partselect.com/Models/DRSR495EG8WW/Parts/) 
2. I need the [front drum bearing](https://www.partselect.com/PS960316-GE-WE3M26-Front-Drum-Bearing.htm?SourceCode=21&SearchTerm=DRSR495EG8WW&ModelNum=DRSR495EG8WW), along with the Manufacturer Part Number: `WE3M26` to search for on Amazon
3. I wanted to go with the GE brand since it was the same price as others but [this kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZR5WXYH) has the part number in the title to give me warm and fuzzies
	1. This is a kit with everything that needs replaced! (I'm assuming this is what is wrong, not much else that could be causing the squeek)
