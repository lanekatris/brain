*DALL-E future space recycle bin*


I was clearing up space on my Windows machine. I had deleted some multi-gigabyte `node_modules` folders and as I was using the Windows GUI I thought this will take a while...

So I looked up a CLI way. Using Powershell 7.3 I see [Clear-RecycleBin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/clear-recyclebin?view=powershell-7.3)! Easy peasy. It doesn't give you a progress bar but I don't mind.

I wanted a way to get the size of your recycle bin via CLI but didn't see something super straight forward. I'll look into that for the future.
