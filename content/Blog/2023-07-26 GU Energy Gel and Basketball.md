During the winter I play basketball with a group I used to previously work with. It's a good bit of cardio as you'd expect and I would always crash during the 2 hours.

I found eating an hour beforehand helps, but mainly eating a [GU Energy Gel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQ7QDQA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) helps out a ton!

It is fast to consume as well; compared to chewing for a while on a Clif bar for example.
