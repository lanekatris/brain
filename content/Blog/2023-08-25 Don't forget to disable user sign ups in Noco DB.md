I expose my Noco DB instance to the web and didn't want others to be able to sign in. I expose views here and there.


I was reading how to do it via environment variables [here](https://forum.cloudron.io/topic/6552/restricting-registration/5).

That variable was removed come to find out [here](https://docs.nocodb.com/getting-started/environment-variables).

So you can go here to disable sign ups:

`/dashboard/#/account/users/settings`
