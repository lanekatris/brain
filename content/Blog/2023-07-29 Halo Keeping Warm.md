I'm Halo's biggest fan. Although I'm not the biggest fan of Infinite. 

I turn on gaming on Twitch.tv as I'm working on the computer for background noise.

I saw https://www.twitch.tv/gunshottv playing a tournament and in between games he was setting up bots to keep his shot warm.

The settings are what made sense and kept his aim on:
- FFA
- Unlimited ammo
- You can't die
- BR start


I had never done it, so was neat to see.
